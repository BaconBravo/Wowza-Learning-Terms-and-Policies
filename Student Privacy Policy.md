Wowza Learning is dedicated to making learning awesome, and we take the privacy of our users seriously. Keeping students’ personal information safe is a priority at Wowza Learning. This Student Privacy Policy explains how we use the personal information we collect from and about students when they engage with Wowza Learning in the classroom through the products that are offered to schools and teachers in Wowza Learning. As set forth below, we use such personal information solely as a service provider to our school and school district customers.

To learn about our practices with respect to other users, including teachers who sign up for Wowza Learning and student accountholders who use Wowza Learning outside of the school environment, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/BaconBravo/Wowza-Learning-Terms-and-Policies/blob/main/Privacy%20Policy.md).

## **2. Our handling of student information** 

As a trusted provider of tools that help teachers and schools make learning awesome for students, Wowza Learning is particularly concerned about the use of students’ personal information. We only request the personal information of students that we need to provide the School Services, and we comply with privacy laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), as applicable.

Wowza Learning does not collect, retain, use or share students’ personal information, except as necessary for authorized school purposes, at the direction of our school and school district customers. Without limitation, this means that:

- We do not sell students’ personal information.
- We do not serve targeted ads on our platforms and not use information we collect to serve targeted ads on other services. Wowza Learning does not use or disclose information collected through our services for any targeted advertising purposes.
- We do not build a profile of a student.
- We do not knowingly retain students’ personal information beyond the time period required to play a game support the authorized school purposes.

Where required by applicable law, we support our school customers in providing parents and eligible students with access to their personal information and in fulfilling other requests that parents and eligible students may make under applicable law, such as the right to request deletion of students’ personal information or to refuse its further collection or use. Wowza Learning maintains a comprehensive program designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of students’ personal information.

### 3. Students’ **Personal information**

### 3.1 Personal **information we collect from students**

Student players: Wowza Learning collects only a nickname, which is anonymous and not linked to a persistent identifier, from a student who merely plays a Wowza Learning game. We use the nickname to permit the student to play.

Personal information collected at a teacher’s direction: Certain features of the School Services permit a teacher to collect information about the class, as well as about individual students, such as attendance, results, answers submitted when playing Wowza Learning games (including in response to open-ended questions) and performance on Wowza Learning games. We use such information only to provide the services to the teacher, such as to permit the teacher to interact with students and track their progress over time. A school or teacher may permit students to share information with others, such as with other students in the same class, school, or school district.

**3.2** **Information collected automatically**

No personal information is collected automatically from students who engage with Wowza Learning through the School Services. Product usage data that is collected by Wowza Learning from the School Services is always anonymized or aggregated and cannot be linked to individual students.

**3.3** **Anonymized information**

We may anonymize and/or aggregate personal information so that it no longer identifies any student. We may use and disclose such anonymized and/or aggregated information for any purpose, including for analytics purposes, to help us understand how our products are used and improve upon them.

### **4. Compliance with FERPA **and COPPA

We comply with FERPA and COPPA when applicable to us. When FERPA applies, we act as a ”school official” to our school or school district customer, which means that we are under the direct control of the school or district and use students’ personal information only to provide our services to the school or district and not for our own purposes. To the extent COPPA applies, the school or district provides us with any necessary consent on behalf of students’ parents or guardians to permit use of Wowza Learning in the classroom.
